# Bookshelves

## Application
* The application keeps track of books that users read. The name Bookshelves comes from dividing books on three shelves:
    1. New books added to the reading list
    2. Book(s) that the reader is currently reading
    3. Books that have been read earlier
* The app was written in Flutter (Dart).

## Manual and how to use the app
* The application starts on the Home page which shows book statistics. You can navigate to other screens from the navigation bar in the bottom of the screen.
* Click Add Book button if you want to add a new book to the reading list. On Add a new book page, enter book title, author and choose the language you are reading the book in. Click Save when done.
* When a new book is added to the reading list, it is placed to the Not Started shelf. When the user starts reading a book, the book status is updated to Reading and it is placed on the Reading shelf. When reading is finished, the book is marked as completed and moved to reading completed shelf.
