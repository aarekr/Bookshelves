# Bookshelves

## Application
* The application keeps track of books that users read. The name Bookshelves comes from dividing books on three shelves:
    1. New books added to the reading list
    2. Book(s) that the reader is currently reading
    3. Books that have been read earlier
* The app was written in Flutter (Dart).

## Manual and how to use the app
* When a new book is added to a reading list, it is placed to the not read shelve/category. When the user start reading a book, the book status is updated to reading and it is placed on currently reading shelf.
